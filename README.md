# AI Chat App 🤖💬

A full-stack **AI-powered chat application** built using **Django**, **Django REST Framework**, **React**, and **OpenAI’s GPT-4 API**.  
This project demonstrates how to build, integrate, and deploy a modern AI assistant web application with a clean frontend and a secure backend.

## Project Overview

This AI Chat App allows users to interact with an intelligent assistant through a responsive and user-friendly chat interface.  
The backend handles chat logic, data persistence and communication with the OpenAI API, while the frontend delivers a sleek UI with real-time interactions.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building a **production-ready fullstack application**, managing API security, handling async data flows, and structuring scalable codebases.
